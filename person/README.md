person model
===================

### For the interviewer
Give the person.rb to the candidate and follow what they're saying on person_answer_key.rb
When you update either model, make sure to update the other.

### For the interviewee
The person model has many bugs, repetitious code, and stylistic issues. Spot and correct as many as you can.
